rebar3 cuttlefish plugin
=====

![Build Status](https://github.com/lrascao/rebar3_scuttler/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
[![Hex version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/rebar3_scuttler.svg "Hex version")](https://hex.pm/packages/rebar3_scuttler)

A rebar3 plugin for [cuttlefish](https://github.com/Kyorai/cuttlefish) schema handling with a slightly different approach than [rebar3_cuttlefish](https://github.com/vernemq/rebar3_cuttlefish).
It departs from the assumption that your Erlang release is already making use of `sys.config` and other `.config` files and you simply want to expose a few specific parameters
in a non-Erlanger `.conf` file for your application users to tweak. 

A cuttlefish recap
-----

[Basho's original cuttlefish project](https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish) came up with the idea of allowing non-Erlanger users to tweak any Erlang application's parameters without
having to understand the complicated proplist syntax. A user simply needs to edit a human readable `.conf` file (like `sysctl.conf`, hence the `cuttlefish` name) and run the application.

Requirements
-----

For the plugin to work you'll need to enable [extended start scripts](http://rebar3.org/docs/deployment/releases/#extended-start-script), `rebar3_scuttler` relies on
[hooks](http://rebar3.org/docs/deployment/releases/#hooks) in order to generate the cuttlefish schema `.config` output files.
    
Integration
-----
    
In order to integrate and make use of this plugin the following steps are needed:

* Include the `rebar3_scuttler` plugin in your project
* Write a [cuttlefish schema](https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish/wiki/Cuttlefish-for-Erlang-Developers) that exposes the application parameters
   you'll allow your users to change.
* Configure the `rebar3_scuttler` plugin
* Add the cuttlefish pre start hook to your release's hooks
* Include the generated `.config` files from your `sys.config`

### Including the plugin

Add the plugin to your project's rebar.config:

```
% this informs rebar3 that the rebar3_scuttler plugin will take over
% the release generation process, this is necessary so that it is able
% to inject the cuttlefish invocation to the pre-start release hook
{project_plugins, [
    {rebar3_scuttler,
        {git, "https://github.com/lrascao/rebar3_scuttler",
            {branch, "master"}}}
]}.
```

### Writing the cuttlefish schema

Basho's original [cuttlefish project documentation](https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish/wiki/Cuttlefish-for-Erlang-Developers) has everything needed.

Here is an example of configuration for the `lhttpc` application:

```
%% @doc Number of default workers for each lhttpc pool
{mapping, "lhttpc.pool_size", "lhttpc.pool_size", [
    {default, 10},
    {datatype, integer}
]}.
```

Files containing cuttlefish schemas should have the `.schema` extension, you should source control them along with your application
(a typical place to store them is beneath the `priv` dir).

### Configuring the plugin

`rebar3_scuttler` has the following `rebar.config` options:

```
% scuttler plugin opts
{scuttler, [
    % this is the human readable .conf file that the users of your application
    % will understand and edit in order to change configuration parameters,
    % it's location is relative to the root dir of the release
    % (ie. alongside bin, releases, etc)
    {conf_file, "etc/simple_web_server.conf"},
    % a list of cuttlefish schemas to find in your project and it's
    % dependencies and the corresponding output file, this is a list of tuples
    % that can the following forms:
    %
    %   `{vm_args, OutputFile}`
    %       A heavily annotated .schema file maintained by the plugin with up to date
    %       Erlang VM parameters. This vm.args schema is copied to the release directory
    %       to the `releases/{{release_version}}/erlang.vm.args.schema`
    %
    %       Generated vm.args files can be included from the main vm.args file
    %       using the `-args_file` parameter
    %       eg. vm.args
    %           -cookie somecookie
    %           -name nodename
    %           -args_file vm.generated.args
    %
    %   `{Discovery :: auto_discover | string(),
    %     ReleaseSchemaDir :: string(),
    %     OutputFile :: string()}`
    %   
    %       Discovery ::
    %           auto_discover: finds *.schema files in:
    %                           priv/*.schema
    %                           priv/schema/*.schema
    %                           priv/schemas/*.schema
    %                           schema/*.schema
    %                           schemas/*.schema
    %           "<dir>": find all *.schema in dir, this can take the form of a 
    %                    mustache template with the following vars:
    %                       deps_dir: rebar3 dependencies dir
    %
    %       ReleaseSchemaDir::
    %           Specifies the location relative to the release dir where the referred schemas will be
    %           copied to. 
    %
    %       OutputFile:
    %           Specifies the .config or vm.args filename that cuttlefish generates
    %           out of each schema.
    %
    %           Config files are then intended to be
    %           included in your sys.config file.
    %           eg. sys.config
    %           [
    %               {myapp, [
    %                   {my_conf1, value}
    %               ]},
    %
    %               "releases/{{release_version}}/config/generated/user_defined.config",
    %               "releases/{{release_version}}/config/generated/riak_core.config"
    %           ].
    %
    {schemas, [
           {vm_args, "releases/{{release_version}}/vm.generated.args"},
           {"priv/schemas", "releases/{{release_version}}/schema",
            "releases/{{release_version}}/config/generated/user_defined.config"},
           {"{{deps_dir}}/riak_core/priv", "releases/{{release_version}}/schema/riak_core",
                "releases/{{release_version}}/config/generated/riak_core.config"}
    ]},
    % Specifies where you'd like rebar3_scuttler to generate
    % the pre start hook to. This is intended to be then added
    % to the extended_start_script_hooks/pre_start relx entry list
    % for it to be invoked prior to the release start
    % This script will take care of processing `.schema` and `.conf`
    % files in order to output `.config` files that you will be able
    % to include from your own.
    {pre_start_hook, "bin/hooks/pre_start_cuttlefish"}
]}.
```

### Adding the pre start hook

Create or add the `extended_start_script_hooks` entry to `rebar.config` `relx`'s section, if you were already
using it's just a matter of adding another `custom` entry to `pre_start`.

```
    % start script hooks
    {extended_start_script_hooks, [
        {pre_start, [
          % besides our own pre start script, we're here adding
          % the one that was generated out of rebar3_scuttler,
          % this script will pick up any .schema file in share/schema
          % and generate a same named .config file in `output_dir`
          %
          % notice that the name here matches the one we defined above in
          % scuttler.pre_start_hook, it's just missing the `bin` prefix because
          % start script hooks are relative to the extended start script location.
          {custom, "hooks/pre_start_cuttlefish"}
        ]}
    ]}
```

### Including generated files

Finally, in your `sys.config` file you can include the generated `.config` file as [per the OTP doc](https://erlang.org/doc/man/config.html).

```
 [
     {myapp, [
           {my_conf1, value}
     ]},

     "releases/{{release_version}}/config/generated/user_defined.config"
 ].
```

The same can be applied to your `vm.args` file, that is being templated in `relx`'s `overlay` section:

```
    {overlay, [
        ...
        {template, "config/vm.args", "releases/{{release_version}}/vm.args"}
        ...
    ]}
```

Your developer maintained `vm.args` can now include the runtime generated args file
by using `args_file`.

```
-name nodename

-setcookie cookie

-args_file releases/{{release_version}}/vm.generated.args
```
